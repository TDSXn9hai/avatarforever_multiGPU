## Highlights

| Capability | Result |
|---|---:|
| Video resolution | 768 × 512 |
| End-to-end throughput | **27.2 FPS** |
| Hardware | **1× NVIDIA H100** |

End-to-end throughput includes both DiT inference and VAE decoding.

## Overview

Avatar-Forever is a framework for high-quality, real-time, and effectively unbounded audio-driven avatar generation. It addresses a central limitation of existing streaming video systems: sequential distillation pipelines entangle few-step efficiency with long-horizon robustness, so distribution shifts and optimization failures introduced early in training propagate to later stages.

Our key insight is to learn these capabilities independently and compose them only at deployment:

- **Efficiency branch:** full-parameter distribution matching distillation trains a high-quality few-step generator.
- **Robustness branch:** a lightweight long-horizon adapter is trained with **Recovery-oriented Rollout Training (RRT)** under accumulated autoregressive errors.
- **Streaming inference:** **ForeverCache** reuses stable historical features across denoising steps to avoid redundant context computation.

## Inference

### Installation

The released inference code is organized as a `uv` workspace and requires Python 3.11 and a CUDA-capable GPU. From the repository root, install all workspace packages with:

```bash
uv sync --all-packages
```

Optional optimized attention backends depend on the target GPU and CUDA environment.

### Model checkpoints

Model weights are not stored in Git. Download both the Avatar-Forever checkpoint and the Gemma text encoder into `checkpoints/` so the repository has this layout:

```text
checkpoints/
├── avatarforever-ltx-2.3-22b.safetensors
└── gemma-3-12b-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized/
    ├── config.json
    ├── tokenizer.json
    └── ...
```

Install the Hugging Face CLI and authenticate first. Gemma is a gated model, so accept its license on [Google's Gemma 3 12B QAT model page](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-12b-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized) before downloading:

```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub
hf auth login

hf download LetsThink/AvatarForever \
  avatarforever-ltx-2.3-22b.safetensors \
  --local-dir checkpoints

hf download google/gemma-3-12b-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized \
  --local-dir checkpoints/gemma-3-12b-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized
```

The `checkpoints/` directory is ignored by Git; do not commit model weights.

### Run inference

```bash
uv run python inference.py \
  --distilled-checkpoint-path checkpoints/avatarforever-ltx-2.3-22b.safetensors \
  --gemma-root checkpoints/gemma-3-12b-it-qat-q4_0-unquantized \
  --audio-path /path/to/input.wav \
  --output-path outputs/result.mp4
```

The default configuration uses one-stage distilled inference at 768 × 512 and 25 FPS, generates 2001 frames, uses AR chunk size 4 with one history chunk, derives first-frame channel conditioning from the first generated chunk, and saves H.264 video at CRF 12. Frame counts must be positive and follow `8n+1`, such as 161, 2001, or 8001.

Use `python inference.py --help` to see all controls, including video length, autoregressive history, first-frame conditioning, VAE tiling, x264 CRF, and encoding preset.

### Prompt guidance

The following general-purpose prompt is the default for audio-driven generation:

```text
Natural audio-driven speaking motion with accurate lip synchronization, smooth and continuous facial animation, subtle head movement, natural blinking, gentle breathing, and relaxed upper-body motion. Expressions and gestures should respond naturally to the rhythm, tone, and emotion of the speech while remaining restrained and realistic.

Maintain strong temporal consistency across all frames. Keep facial appearance, identity, pose, body structure, clothing details, lighting, and background stable throughout the video. Avoid sudden motion changes, excessive gestures, unnatural expression shifts, frame-to-frame appearance variation, flickering, jitter, ghosting, texture instability, temporal artifacts, or deformation. All motion should be coherent, fluid, stable, and naturally driven by the audio.
```

For longer videos, prepend a concrete scene description covering the subject, identity and appearance, framing, pose, clothing, lighting, background, and camera position. For T2V scene generation, describe the visual content and scene details explicitly, then append the motion and temporal-stability prompt above. When the composition should remain stable, also specify a single continuous shot with a fixed camera and no cuts, transitions, angle changes, or viewpoint changes.

## Why Avatar-Forever?

Streaming avatar generation must satisfy two objectives that operate on different temporal scales:

1. **Few-step efficiency** preserves visual quality while reducing the number of denoising steps.
2. **Long-horizon robustness** prevents identity drift, motion degradation, and error accumulation over recursive rollouts.

Optimizing both objectives inside one sequential distillation pipeline creates stage-wise dependence and objective interference. Avatar-Forever instead trains them in parallel, making the training process simpler to optimize, diagnose, and scale.

## Method

### Decoupled Parallel Training

Starting from a 22B video foundation model, Avatar-Forever separates efficient generation from long-horizon adaptation. The resulting robustness adapter is merged with the distilled few-step generator at deployment.

### Recovery-oriented Rollout Training

RRT targets the error-propagation pattern encountered during streaming inference. It perturbs an early historical context, rolls the degradation forward through multiple autoregressive chunks, and applies standard flow-matching supervision after errors have accumulated. The model therefore learns to recover under long-horizon inference conditions rather than only reconstruct locally corrupted inputs.

### ForeverCache

ForeverCache is a chunk-wise history feature cache for streaming diffusion inference. It populates historical context features on the first denoising step of each chunk, then reuses those stable features while forwarding only the current chunk tokens in subsequent steps.
